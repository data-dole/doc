### DOLE
DOLE is a standard to create a knowledge base and supporting tools in a meaningful and flexible way.

### Overview
DOLE is a acronim which includes four steps to build a knowledge base:

* **D**efine - create simple objects which compose described system using basic attributes
* **O**rganise - set ownership among objects
* **L**ink - add relations between objects
* **E**xplore - use tools to search, read and analyse the resulting knowledge base 

The standard defines how data should be organised so different compatible tools can be created

### Terms

* _knowlege base_ - information which should be structured and available 
* _item_ - a logical unit of knowledge base
* _attribute_ 
* _ownership_ - a parent-child relation between items
* _reference_ 

### Requirements

* _Knowledge base_ has many items
* _Item_ has many attributes
* _Attribute's_ value can refer to an item
* Item's _ownership_ is independent from item's attributes and incoming references
